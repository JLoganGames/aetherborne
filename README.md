Aetherborne

Aetherborne is an action RPG focused on loot-driven progression, open-world exploration, and player-defined power growth. Players level up by completing quests, defeating enemies, and hunting for rare, tier-based gear dropped from specific mobs and bosses. Strategic stat allocation and exploration shape each player's unique path.

🌟 Core Features
🔥 Loot-Driven Progression

Enemies and bosses drop randomized gear.

Tiered loot system (T1–T6).

Certain items drop only from specific enemy types.

⚔️ Leveling System

Level cap: 100

Leveling slows down as players progress.

Each level grants a choice between Health, Mana, or Stamina.

🧭 Exploration

Zones reward exploration with secrets, rare mobs, and unique loot pools.

Hidden areas, puzzles, and Aether anomalies expand the world.

🏛️ PvP Arenas

Optional PvP arenas with matchmaking.

Players may choose to stop gaining XP to compete in specific brackets.

Leaderboards track top performers.

🎲 Randomness Done Right

Strong grind-to-reward gameplay loop.

Even weak enemies can rarely drop powerful gear.

Progression continues beyond early lucky drops.
